====================================================================================================
Commands
x create single UserCommand class
    x has field for command type
    x has field for set of args passed in by workload generator

x replace CommandTypes with CommandCodes class to simply store API_CODE values

x update jersey resource commands to reflect single user command

====================================================================================================
Jersey Resources
x create resource classes for remaining commands
- validate incoming commands
    - create class responsible for validating fields of different commands
        - all fields:
            - presence of field value (if required)
            - conforms to regex (if applicable)

        - workloadId:
            - positive integer

        - dollars/cents:
            - positive integer

        - stockSymbol:
            - all chars (all caps?)


====================================================================================================
TransactionService
x update service to take generic UserCommand class as arguement when sending commands
- change service to send bytes over a socket instead of JSON to improve efficiency
    - use the transaction server's ServerConstants class to configure target host of transaction server
    - user ServerConstants to configure and use currently active web server host when sending commands
    - receive and interpret response from tx server

====================================================================================================
Template System
- develop hierarchy of templates
    - write base template
    - write template for each command that corresponds to a form

- integrate twitter bootstrap

====================================================================================================
TemplateService
- handle errors from transaction server properly
    - issue: how to determine if response is erroneous?
        - solution: map http methods to their acceptable status codes. check to see if transaction response code is in this map

    - issue: how to dynamically display error templates based on command and response?
        - solution: write custom error template for each command. delegate error handling to the jersey resource through "@ErrorTemplate" tag
